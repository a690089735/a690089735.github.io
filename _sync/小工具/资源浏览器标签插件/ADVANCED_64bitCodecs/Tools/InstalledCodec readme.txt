  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
  NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers32

Using InstalledCodec
====================

InstalledCodec doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. Just copy the executable file (InstalledCodec.exe) to any folder
you like, and run it.
The main window of InstalledCodec displays the list of all Codec drivers
and DirectShow filters. You can easily select one or more components, and
then disable or enable them, export the information into text/xml/html
file, or copy the information to the clipboard, and then paste it to
Excel or OpenOffice spreadsheet.



Disable/Enable Codec drivers and DirectShow filters
===================================================

If you install multiple Codec packages and other multimedia software on
the same computer, you might find out that some multimedia files are not
played properly as before. This problem is occurred if Windows Media
Player (or any other player) uses the codec or filter of the newly
installed multimedia software. If you install a new Codec package and
something goes wrong, you can try to fix the problem disabling the newly
installed components. To easily find out the newly installed components,
try to click the 'Installed/Modfied Time' column, the components list
will be sorted by installation time, and then you'll find most of the
newly installed Codec or DirectShow filters in the end of the list.
