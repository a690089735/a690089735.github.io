Launcher64.exe removes previous versions of my software and also any other codecpacks you have installed.
Launcher64.exe will clear a memory block previously alocated to the App (this helps avoid a crash) 
You can also execute ..\Tools\Settings64_portable.exe directly to use the Application.
I recommend using the Launcher.

To stop using this portable version, go to the Help tab and use the button, [- Remove ALL -]
This action unregisters the codecs and removes registry entries and ini files that were required by the App.

If you physically relocate this product from one place to another;
example, moving the distribution folder from the Desktop to some other place on your computer,
It is imperitive that you use the button, [- Remove ALL -] to re-setup the codecs to their new location. (this helps avoid a crash)
