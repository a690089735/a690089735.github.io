                  <li>a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
                     Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may
                     not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work
                     to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
                     keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute
                     or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures
                     on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
                     under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
                     the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon
                     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
                     4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
                     from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

                     a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike

                     the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer
                     of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute

                     the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
                     the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
                     the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

                     by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage

                     made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means
                     You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
                     and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
                     ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
                     or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
                     specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
                     for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work
                     in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
                     Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
                     the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
                     the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
                     the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
                     of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
                     assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
                     as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
                     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

                           exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

                           otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any

                           any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial

                     mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
                     honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
                     in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification
                     or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
                     as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
                     exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

                     provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes

            <p><a name="GUID-80E26EFA-1AAE-4BFF-84EB-79300555A130"></a>You must explicitly credit Autodesk, Inc., as the original source of the materials. This is a standard requirement of the
               Attribution (BY) term in all Creative Commons licenses. In some cases, such as for the Autodesk video learning content, we
               specify exactly how we would like to be attributed.

            <p><a name="GUID-06FD2123-52CA-45FB-BAC7-AD311836871A"></a>This is usually described on the video's end-plate. For the most part providing the title of the work, the URL where the work
               is hosted, and a credit to Autodesk, Inc., is quite acceptable. Also, remember to keep intact any copyright notice associated
               with the work. This may sound like a lot of information, but there is flexibility in the way you present it.
